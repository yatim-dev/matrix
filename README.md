# Matrix Arithmetic Operations

This project is designed to implement arithmetic operations on matrices. The matrix is a rectangular array of numbers, and it plays a vital role in mathematics as well as in programming. The aim of this project is to create a function that can perform various arithmetic operations, i.e., addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, on matrices. 

## Installation

To use this library, you need to clone or download the repository to your local machine. Then, add the `Matrix` class file to your project, and you are ready to start using it.

## Usage

To use the `Matrix` class, you first create an instance of it and pass a two-dimensional array of numbers representing your matrix as a parameter. Then, you can perform arithmetic operations using the built-in methods, such as `AddMatrix()`, `SubMatrix()`, `MulMatrix()`, and `DivMatrix()`. For example:

Matrix sum = matrix1.AddMatrix(matrix2);
Matrix difference = matrix1.SubMatrix(matrix2);
Matrix product = matrix1.MulMatrix(matrix2);
Matrix quotient = matrix1.DivMatrix(matrix2);
